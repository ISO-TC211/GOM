// _incomplete_... perhaps the metadata required for ConceptSchemes should be required for the Standard

== Section Assessment

=== Determine Document Sections

The sections in this technical specification relevant for semantic assessment are determined to be:

* *2 Normative references*
** contains a structured bibligraphy, members of which may be referred to by multiple Standards
* *3 Terms and definitions*
** these form a vocabulary and vocabulary elements may be used in multiple Standards
* *4 Conformance*
** the lsit of conformance classes here form vocabularies
* *5 Coverages*
** the list of Conformance classes, Requirements Recommendations & Permissions given here form vocabularies
* *6 Multi-point coverages*
** the list of Conformance classes, Requirements Recommendations & Permissions given here form vocabularies
* *7 General grid coverages*
** the list of Conformance classes, Requirements Recommendations & Permissions given here form vocabularies
* *8 Mulit-curve coverages*
** the list of Conformance classes, Requirements Recommendations & Permissions given here form vocabularies
* *9 Multi-surface coverages*
** the list of Conformance classes, Requirements Recommendations & Permissions given here form vocabularies
* *10 Multi-solid coverages*
** the list of Conformance classes, Requirements Recommendations & Permissions given here form vocabularies
* *11 Coverage partitionings*
** the list of Conformance classes, Requirements Recommendations & Permissions given here form vocabularies
* *12 coverage encodings*
** the list of Conformance classes, Requirements Recommendations & Permissions given here form vocabularies
* *Annex A - Abstract test suites*
** contains a vocabulary of tests
* *Annex B - Rectified and referenceable grid coverages*
** the list of Conformance classes, Requirements Recommendations & Permissions given here form vocabularies
* *Bibliography*
** contains a structured bibliography, members of which may be referred to by multiple Standards

=== Recommendations per section

|===
| Section | Recommendation | Next action for this Standard

| *2 Normative references* 
| A Semantic Web form of an ISO TC 211 bibliographic references library should be created and authoratitive references to elements within it used instead of textual references
| None: pending a TC 211 references library
| *3 Terms and definitions* | Placement within GeoLexica | Ensure item noted in TMG Review
| *4 Conformance* | Establish SW vocabularies for these elements | Talk with GOM regarding this new form of vocabulary
| *5 Coverages* | Establish SW vocabularies for these elements | Talk with GOM regarding this new form of vocabulary
| *6 Multi-point coverages* | Auto-generation of OWL model form; Establish SW vocabularies for these elements | Confirm GOM can generate and consult GOM to form vocabularies
| *7 General grid coverages* | Auto-generation of OWL model form; Establish SW vocabularies for these elements | Confirm GOM can generate and consult GOM to form vocabularies
| *8 Mulit-curve coverages* | Auto-generation of OWL model form; Establish SW vocabularies for these elements | Confirm GOM can generate and consult GOM to form vocabularies
| *9 Mulit-surface coverages* | Auto-generation of OWL model form; Establish SW vocabularies for these elements | Confirm GOM can generate and consult GOM to form vocabularies
| *10 Mulit-solid coverages* | Auto-generation of OWL model form; Establish SW vocabularies for these elements | Confirm GOM can generate and consult GOM to form vocabularies
| *11 Coverage partitionings* | Auto-generation of OWL model form; Establish SW vocabularies for these elements | Confirm GOM can generate and consult GOM to form vocabularies
| *12 Coverage encodings* | Auto-generation of OWL model form; Establish SW vocabularies for these elements | Confirm GOM can generate and consult GOM to form vocabularies
| *Annex A - Abstract test suites* | Establish SW vocabularies for these elements | Talk with GOM regarding this new form of vocabulary
| *Annex B - Rectified and referenceable grid coverages* | Auto-generation of OWL model form; Establish SW vocabularies for these elements | Confirm GOM can generate and consult GOM to form vocabularies
