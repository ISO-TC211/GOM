** these form a vocabulary and vocabulary elements may be used in multiple Standards
* *3.1 Abbreviations*
** these form a vocabulary and vocabulary elements may be used in multiple Standards
* *4 Conformance*
** the list of Conformance classes given here form vocabularies
* *8 Marine georegulation application schema*
** this contains the formalized data model of the Standard
** contains following codelists: "MG_PartyTypeList, MG_GroupPartyTypeList, MG_LimitTypeList, MG_ArcGeomoetryTypeList, MG_ZoneTypeList, MG_JurisdictionDomainTypeList, LA_SurfaceRelationType, MG_SpaceTypeList, MG_AvailabilityStatusType

| None: pending a TC 211 references library

| *3 Terms and definitions* | Placement within GeoLexica | Ensure item noted in TMG Review
| *3.1 Abbreviations* | Placement within GeoLexica | Ensure item noted in TMG Review
| *4 Conformance* | Establish SW vocabularies for these elements | Talk with GOM regarding this new form of vocabulary
| *8 Marine georegulation application schema* | Auto-generation of OWL model form | Confirm GOM can generate
| *8 Marine georegulation application schema* | Establish SW vocabularies for these elements | Talk with GOM regarding this new form of vocabulary
| *Annex A - Abstract test suites* | Establish SW vocabularies for these elements | Talk with GOM regarding this new form of vocabulary
