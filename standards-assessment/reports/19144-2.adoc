// _incomplete_... perhaps the metadata required for ConceptSchemes should be required for the Standard

== Section Assessment

=== Determine Document Sections

The sections in this technical specification relevant for semantic assessment are determined to be:

* *2 Normative references*
** contains a structured bibligraphy, members of which may be referred to by multiple Standards
* *3 Terms and definitions*
** these form a vocabulary and vocabulary elements may be used in multiple Standards
* *4 Conformance*
** the list of Conformance Classes here form vocabularies
* *8 LCML Objects*
** this contains the formalized data model of the standard
** the formalized model contains several codelists 
* *Annex A - Abstract test suites*
** contains a vocabulary of tests
* *Annex D - Glossary of land cover meta-elements*
** these form a vocabulary and vocabulary elements

=== Recommendations per section

|===
| Section | Recommendation | Next action for this Standard

| *2 Normative references* 
| A Semantic Web form of an ISO TC 211 bibliographic references library should be created and authoratitive references to elements within it used instead of textual references
| None: pending a TC 211 references library

| *3 Terms and definitions* | Placement within GeoLexica | Ensure item noted in TMG Review
| *4 Conformance* | Establish SW vocabularies for these elements | Talk with GOM regarding this new form of vocabulary
| *8 LCMLS Objects* | Auto-generation of OWL model form | Confirm GOM can generate
| *Annex A - Abstract test suites* | Establish SW vocabularies for these elements | Talk with GOM regarding this new form of vocabulary
| *Annex D - Glossary of land cover meta-elements* | Potentially placement within GeoLexica | Ensure item noted in TMG Review
