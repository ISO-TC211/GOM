_incomplete_... perhaps the metadata required for ConceptSchemes should be required for the Standard

== Section Assessment

=== Determine Document Sections

The sections in this technical specification relevant for semantic assessment are determined to be:

* *2 Normative references*
** contains a structured bibligraphy, members of which may be referred to by multiple Standards
* *3 Terms and definitions*
** these form a vocabulary and vocabulary elements may be used in multiple Standards
* *4 Symbols and Abbreviations*
** these form a vocabulary and vocabulary elements may be used in multiple Standards
* *5 Calibration of remote sensing data*
** this contains the formalized data model of the technical specification
* *8 Calibration of reference sources*
** the list of requirements given here form vocabularies
* *10 Validation of derived products*
** contains an enumeration for "CA_StatisticComputation"
** the list of recommendations given here form vocabularies
* *Annex A - Abstract test suites*
** contains a vocabulary of tests
* *Annex B - Data dictionary*
** contains one enumeration for "domain codes"
** _see demonstration delivery of these codelists at http://115.146.86.155/vocab/EvaluationMethodTypeCode & http://115.146.86.155/vocab/ValueStructure_
* *Bibliography*
** contains a structured bibligraphy, members of which may be referred to by multiple Standards

=== Recommendations per section

|===
| Section | Recommendation | Next action for this Standard

| *2 Normative references* 
| A Semantic Web form of an ISO TC 211 bibliographic references library should be created and authoratitive references to elements within it used instead of textual references
| None: pending a TC 211 references library

| *3 Terms and definitions* | Placement within GeoLexica | Ensure item noted in TMG Review
| *4 Symbols and Abbreviations* | Placement within GeoLexica | Ensure item noted in TMG Review
| *5 Calibration of remote sensing data* | Establish SW vocabularies for these elements | Talk with GOM regarding this new form of vocabulary
| *8 Calibration of reference sources* | Auto-generation of OWL model form | Confirm GOM can generate
| *10 Validation of derived products | See *Annex B* | -
| *Annex A - Abstract test suites* | Establish SW vocabularies for these elements | Talk with GOM regarding this new form of vocabulary
| *Annex B - Data dictionary for data quality* | Establish SW vocabularies for these enumerations | Confirm GOM can generate
| *Bibliography* | As per *2 Normative references* | -
