_incomplete_... perhaps the metadata required for ConceptSchemes should be required for the Standard

== Section Assessment

=== Determine Document Sections

The sections in this standard relevant for semantic assessment are determined to be:

* *2 Normative references*
** contains a structured bibligraphy, members of which may be referred to by multiple standards
* *3 Terms and definitions*
** these form a vocabulary and vocabulary elements may be used in multiple standards
* *5 Conformance*
** the list of Conformance Classes here form vocabularies
* *6 Conceptual Framework for BIM to GIS mapping*
** the list of Conformance classes, Requirements Recommendations & Permissions given here form vocabularies
* *7 BIM to GIS perspective definition*
** the list of Conformance classes, Requirements Recommendations & Permissions given here form vocabularies
* *8 BIM to GIS element mapping*
** the list of Conformance classes, Requirements Recommendations & Permissions given here form vocabularies
* *9 BIM to GIS LOD mapping*
** the list of Conformance classes, Requirements Recommendations & Permissions given here form vocabularies
* *Annex A - Abstract test suites*
** contains a vocabulary of Conformance Tests

=== Recommendations per section

|===
| Section | Recommendation | Next action for this Standard

| *2 Normative references* 
| A Semantic Web form of an ISO TC 211 bibliographic references library should be created and authoratitive references to elements within it used instead of textual references
| None: pending a TC 211 references library
| *3 Terms and definitions* | Placement within GeoLexica | Ensure item noted in TMG Review
| *4 Conformance* | Establish SW vocabularies for these elements | Talk with GOM regarding this new form of vocabulary
| *6 Conceptual Framework for BIM to GIS mapping* | Establish SW vocabularies for these elements | Talk with GOM regarding this new form of vocabulary
| *7 BIM to GIS perspective definition* | Establish SW vocabularies for these elements | Talk with GOM regarding this new form of vocabulary
| *8 BIM to GIS element mapping* | Establish SW vocabularies for these elements | Talk with GOM regarding this new form of vocabulary
| *9 BIM to GIS LOD mapping* | Establish SW vocabularies for these elements | Talk with GOM regarding this new form of vocabulary
| *Annex A - Abstract test suites* | Establish SW vocabularies for these elements | Talk with GOM regarding this new form of vocabulary| -
