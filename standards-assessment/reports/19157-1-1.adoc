_incomplete_... perhaps the metadata required for ConceptSchemes should be required for the Standard

== Section Assessment

=== Determine Document Sections

The sections in this standard relevant for semantic assessment are determined to be:

* *2 Normative references*
** contains a structured bibligraphy, members of which may be referred to by multiple Standards
* *3 Terms and definitions*
** these form a vocabulary and vocabulary elements may be used in multiple Standards
* *4.1 Abbreviations*
** these form a vocabulary and vocabulary elements may be used in multiple Standards
* *6 General requirements for geographic information quality*
** the list of Conformance classes, Requirements Recommendations & Permissions given here form vocabularies
* *8 Components of data quality*
** this contains the formalized data model of the Standard
* *9 Data quality measures*
** contains a code list for "Value structure"
* *Annex A - Abstract test suites*
** contains a vocabulary of tests
* *Annex C - Data dictionary for data quality*
** contains two codelists, for "Evaluation method type" and "Value structure"
** _see demonstration delivery of these codelists at http://115.146.86.155/vocab/EvaluationMethodTypeCode & http://115.146.86.155/vocab/ValueStructure_
* *Bibiligraphy*
** contains a structured bibligraphy, members of which may be referred to by multiple Standards

=== Recommendations per section

|===
| Section | Recommendation | Next action for this Standard

| *2 Normative references* 
| A Semantic Web form of an ISO TC 211 bibliographic references library should be created and authoratitive references to elements within it used instead of textual references
| None: pending a TC 211 references library

| *3 Terms and definitions* | Placement within GeoLexica | Ensure item noted in TMG Review
| *4.1 Abbreviations* | Placement within GeoLexica | Ensure item noted in TMG Review
| *6 General requirements for geographic information quality* | Establish SW vocabularies for these elements | Talk with GOM regarding this new form of vocabulary
| *8 Components of data quality* | Auto-generation of OWL model form | Confirm GOM can generate
| *9 Data quality measures* | See *Annex C* | -
| *Annex A - Abstract test suites* | Establish SW vocabularies for these elements | Talk with GOM regarding this new form of vocabulary
| *Annex C - Data dictionary for data quality* | Establish SW vocabularies for these codelists | Confirm GOM can generate
| *Bibiligraphy* | As per *2 Normative references* | -
