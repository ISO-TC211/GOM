.. Meeting protocols
.. Roll call
. *Reminder of the purpose of GOM*
.. purpose as it has been to date
.. purpose continuing
. *Evidence continuation of GOM UML-to-OWL conversion*
.. GOM has recently produced an OWL version of ISO/CD 19157-1 [1] (thanks to Jean)
.. ISO/CD 19157-1 review was conducted as part of an assessment process that is being formalised, as per next section
. *Introduction of a formalised Standard Semantic Web assessment procedure*
.. Procedure document at [2]
.. Tested with ISO/CD 19157-1 with results at [3]
.. Future Procedure tests are expected for 2 - 3 Standards, June+
.. Future results will also be listed at [3]
. *Outcomes of new Standard Semantic Web assessment procedure*
.. *Outcome #1* - reuse of GeoLexica work
.. *Outcome #2* - codelist publication as vocabularies
... Stand-alone expressions of Standards' codelists as Semantic Web vocabularies are presented at [4]
.... Includes the popular ISO 19115-1 and ISO 19115-2 codelists
.... Includes ISO 19107 codelists from recent UML-to-OWL
.. *Outcome #3* - future semantic artifacts
... GOM proposes a Bibliography for TC211 in Semantic Web form
.... Idea to be tested with other TC AGs
.... Potential reuse of Zotero SW bibliography model
. *Codelist Vocabulary Publication Proposal*
.. Motivated by _Outcome #1_ above & community requests
.. A formal vocabulary profile has been created to define a data model for TC vocabs that covers off on perceived requirements [5]
... An extension to the ISO 19135 _Item Status_ codelist has been proposed [6] to provide specialised statuses for TC codelists
.... this codelist [7] exemplifies an extended ISO codelist
