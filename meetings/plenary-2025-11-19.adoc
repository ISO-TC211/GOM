==== Progress to date

* ~50 codelists are now publish in production on the OGC's Rainbow at https://defs.opengis.net/prez/catalogs/ogc-cat:hosted/col/defisotc211org:codesets
* PIDs have been allocated using `def.isotc211.org`, e.g. https://def.isotc211.org/common/DateTypeCode
* all new 19115 codelists and some older codelists have been publised in the `/common/` register
* legacy registers of `/CI/`, `/DS/`, `/MD/`, `/RE/` & `/SV/` retained for now
** detailed codelist versioning is implemented
** we propose to deprecate legacy registers
* codelists/sets are linked to their defining standards via a https://defs.opengis.net/prez/object?iri=https://def.isotc211.org/common/standard[supplementary vocab of standards]
** this is the only non-codelist/set vocab so far implemented
* Extended `Role Codes` allow for the indicateion of `original` & `addition` variants of `stable`
** to show stable terms as being from the standard `original` or additions
* several voccabs - from 19137 - are SKOS+ vocabs, indicating OWL classing
** e.g. https://defs.opengis.net/prez/object?uri=https://def.isotc211.org/common/ValueStructure/bag[ValueStructure]

Initial production publication is now complete.

==== Next steps

1. completion of publication all 19* codelists
2.
