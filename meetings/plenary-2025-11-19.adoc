==== Progress to date

* ~50 codelists are now publish in production on the OGC's Rainbow at https://defs.opengis.net/prez/catalogs/ogc-cat:hosted/col/defisotc211org:codesets
* PIDs have been allocated using `def.isotc211.org`, e.g. https://def.isotc211.org/common/DateTypeCode
* all new 19115 codelists and some older codelists have been publised in the `/common/` register
* legacy registers of `/CI/`, `/DS/`, `/MD/`, `/RE/` & `/SV/` retained for now
** detailed codelist versioning is implemented to handle legacy & new
** e.g. `isDefinedBy` for terms' defining vocab v. `inScheme` for reuse
** we propose to deprecate legacy registers
* codelists/sets are linked to their defining standards via a https://defs.opengis.net/prez/object?iri=https://def.isotc211.org/common/standard[supplementary vocab of standards]
** this is the only non-codelist/set vocab so far implemented
* Extended https://def.isotc211.org/RE/ItemStatus[Register Item Status Codes] allow for the indicateion of `original` & `addition` variants of `stable`
** to show stable terms as being from the standard `original` or additions
* several voccabs - from 19137 - are SKOS+ vocabs, indicating OWL classing
** e.g. https://defs.opengis.net/prez/object?uri=https://def.isotc211.org/common/ValueStructure/bag[ValueStructure]

Initial production publication is now complete.

==== Next steps

1. completion of publication all 19* codelists
2. outreach to codelist users
** encourage users to move to official versions and provide feedback
** guage apetite for extended ontology and alternate forms
3. how to use
** documentation - on patterns used for versioning, statuses, codelist extension
** training - within TC & beyond. Engagement with WGs and individuals to best use the vocabs
4. exercise governance
** probably for 19115 codesets
5. demo of vocabs within ontology context - next item
6. demo of further SKOS+ vocabs
** to demo creeping semantics
** inc. https://defs-hosted.opengis.net/prez-hosted/catalogs/hosted:iso-19157-3/collections/ns10:qualityMeasure[19157 already test published on the Rainbow 'Hosted']

4. *Ontology production proposal*
