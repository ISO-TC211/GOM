. *Reminder of the purpose of GOM*
. *Standards' Semantic Web review progress*
.. review process has been a placholder for the last 12 months
.. Standards reviewed: 
... see https://github.com/ISO-TC211/GOM/tree/master/standards-assessment/reports
... 19166, 19124-2, 19157-3
.. process to start becomeing "real" now that TC-211 Semantic Web publishing facility is available
.. ontology publication next step
. *Standards' Semantic Web resource publication progress*
.. ISO Codelists now published in production
... see http://def.isotc211.org/codelists/
... first ~50 published - the ones test published previously
... Persistent IRIs in place, e.g. http://def.isotc211.org/19115/-1/2018/CitationAndResponsiblePartyInformation/code/CI_RoleCode
.... redirects in place from `def.isotc211.org` namespace location to https://defs.opengis.net/prez/[OGC Rainbow Infrastructure] using GOM website established in 2018
... codelist content managed as a Knowledge Graph catalogue at https://github.com/ISO-TC211/codelist-vocabs


. *Discussion*

_These points are not locked in and we want input, that's why they are listed here in "Discussion"._

.. *Standards' Semantic Web review progress*
... start to require codelist publication as vocabularies
.... GOM can assist in vocabulary creation
... start revising auto-generated ontologies
.... test publish ontologies via Rainbow - as below
.. *Standards' Semantic Web resource publication progress*
... Immediate Next Steps
.... ISO branding to be applied
.... remaining ~150 codelists to be published by next meeting
.... full Linked Data redirects to be implemented, not just HTML
..... we will ask OGC to reuse their redirection infrastructure
.... allow additional formats - e.g. Genericode
.... Test ontology publication
..... soon to be teehncially supported by the Rainbow
..... joint ISO/OGC test with GeoSPARQL
... Nedium-term Steps
.... Formalise Enumeration v. codelist publication
... Longer-term Steps
.... Codelist governance
..... all standards editors need to be involved
..... Reg. Main. Group & GOM need to work together maintaining ongoing SemWeb publication
.... Consider codelists v. total potential vocabulary scope
.... Removal of pirate publications, e.g. https://wiki.esipfed.org/ISO_19115_and_19115-2_CodeList_Dictionaries
..... If we can match all their delivery needs
