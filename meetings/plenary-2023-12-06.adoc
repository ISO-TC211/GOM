Based on the experience of operating registries for organisations similar requirements to TC211, in particular the http://defs.opengis.net/vocprez/[Open Geospatial Consortium's Naming Authority] and the https://cgi.vocabs.ga.gov.au/[Commission for Geoscience Information], we can estimate the following tasks and _rough order of magnitude_ costs for TC211 to run a registry if using similar tools. 

The tool considered for use is https://prez.dev[Prez], an open-source product developed for vocabulary and catalogue information delivery. It is partly mantained by the OGC for use in its 'Rainbow' - the OGC's reference catalogues and machine-readable data. Prez was used to demonstrate a codelists vocabulary register in AG6 (GOM) sessions during ISO/TC211 Plenary in Dec '22 and May'23. It is currently used widely and it is free. Examples of operational use are:

* https://data-uat.bgs.ac.uk/[British Geological Survey's Linked Data assets]
* https://cgi.vocabs.ga.gov.au/vocab/[Commission for Geoscience Information's vocabularies]
* http://defs.opengis.net/vocprez/[OGC's 'Rainbow']
* https://data.idnau.org/[Aust. Indigenous Data Network's multi-catalogue]

An ISO/TC211 Registry could support multiple registers, e.g. for HM, OWL, XML content, and a specialised "vocabs" register for codelist vocabularies.

The costs below are entirely labour and cloud computing costs with labour being by far the greatest component. Labour is priced at CHF900 per day - the NGO rate of https://kurrawong.ai[KurrawongAI] who supports Prez.

The following is a task and cost breakdown.

[width=75%, cols="1,3,1,1"]
|===
| Task  | Description | Effort | Cost

| Establish a Registry system | Create an instance of the Registry software in a public cloud | 1 week | CHF4500
| Customise the Registry | Implement TC211s particular Registers (models, codelists etc) with customised item properties | 2 weeks | CHF9000
| Establish workflows | Create version control system workflows to maintain the state of data in the Registry | 2 weeks | CHF9000
| Train users | Online live training sessions and support for TC211 staff/volunteers to learn to use the system | 1 week equivalent | CHF4500
|===

After the tasks above, TC211 could continue to use the Registry system in the public cloud it established within as a managed service or it could "in-house" the system onto its own cloud or on-prem IT infrastructure:

[width=75%, cols="1,3,1,2"]
|===
| Task  | Description | Effort | Cost

| Operate Register as managed service | Cloud operating costs (perhaps CFH1000 p.a.) + CFH900 to CFH450 per month | ongoing | CHF10800 1st year, expected to reduce to CHF5400
| Hand over system | Work with ISO/TC211 IT support to bring system in-house | 2 weeks effort, elapsed over the timeframe needed | CHF9000 (one-time)
|===

Thus, a total system establishment, customisation, training and one year managed service operation cost could be:

* CHF4500 + CHF9000 + CHF9000 + CHF4500 + CHF10800 = *CHF37,800*
